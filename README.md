## Description

I made a website about game developer portfolio, but basically what I did was to take a design from the internet and implement it on my own without seeing the original code. All this was because I wanted to keep practicing CSS.

## Technologies used

1. CSS3
2. Javascript
3. HTML5

## Galery
